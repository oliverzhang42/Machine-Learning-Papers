### ArXiv Querying:
Currently have a file, ```arxiv_query.py``` which queries arXiv. Doesn't do 
much beyond that.

### Semantic Scholar Parsing:
The file ```sample_parser.py``` parses the file ```sample-S2-records```, which 
is a sample of the larger Semantic Scholar dataset. Current efforts of parsing
this are very rudimentary, but it's my starting point if I end up trying to 
parse all the data.

### Semantic Scholar Querying:
The file ```semantic_query.py``` queries the Semantic Scholar databases and 
parses the data.

### Acknowledgements:
The semantic scholar data is from https://www.semanticscholar.org/.
