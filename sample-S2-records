The iron layer between the ZnO layers facilitates the change in the resistance of the device through the oxidation of the iron at the ZnO/Fe interface, thus generating oxygen vacancies and providing electrons from the redox reaction between γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. The main mechanisms of conduction include Poole–Frenkel emission and Fowler–Nordhein tunneling with the ion migration, oxygen vacancies, and redox reactions of iron oxides (γ-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4). The response of the device to sequential voltage pulses in terms of variation in resistance, RERASE/RWRITE ratio, retention time, and control of the resistance state, through control of the applied voltage, was also evaluated.","inCitations":["2df484cb86a48cecc3cf984a197ba00ad0e8f478","31f626fd43bc9c04504bdf2b110b74543f77b3bb"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A novel structure ZnO-Fe-ZnO thin film memristor","doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2018.06.016","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mssp.2018.06.016","venue":""}

Metodos : Muestra conformada por 115 pacientes diabeticos ambulatorios a quienes se realizo una encuesta para evaluar su autovigilancia, HbA1c y tratamiento. Se midio la glicemia capilar y la Hemoglobina glicosilada. Resultados : De 115 pacientes estudiados (72 mujeres y 43 hombres, edad promedio de 53,3 anos) el tipo de diabetes predominante fue tipo 2 con (87%) los valores de glicemia capilar oscilaron entre 69-460 mg/dl, media de 167 mg/dl; el valor de hemoglobina glicosilada fue 4,7-17,7 %, con una media de 8,7%, 53 pacientes poseian un glicometro ; su medicion de la glicemia venosa era mensual (28,7%). 51 pacientes de la muestra total, conocian el concepto de HbA1c (44,3%) ; de estos el 58,8% sabian el valor normal, la utilidad y el tiempo de realizacion, mostrandose estadisticamente significativo. No se encontro relacion entre el conocimiento de la HbA1c, el automonitoreo y menores valores de HbA1c. Conclusiones : el conocimiento de la HbA1c y la autovigilancia deben mejorar, reforzando las actividades educativas sobre el tema. ABSTRACT : Background : Diabetes is a chronic and incapacitating illness with a raising prevalence, which is a reason for implementing control measures. Methods : The sample of this study was 115 outpatients of the Diabetes Unit, Hospital Vargas, and Hospital Universitario Caracas, Venezuela. A survey was done about their glycemic self control, measurement of HbA1c and treeatment. Capilary glycemia ws also measured. Results: There were 72 women and 43 men, their average age was 53,3 years; 87 % had Diabetes type 2; mesurements of capilary glycemia were 69-490 mg/dl and the levels of HbA1c range 4,7-17,7%. More than half(53%) of the patients owned a glycometer and they had their venous blood sugar measured monthly. Of the whole sample, 51 patients (44,3%) knew the concept of HbA1c, and in this group 58% also knew the normal levels, usefullness, and correct timing of measument forHbA1c; this was statiscally significant. Conclusions : the knowledge of the HbA1c and self-surveillance must improve, reinforcing the educative activities on the subject.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Conocimiento de un grupo de diabéticos venezolanos acerca de la hemoglobina glicosilada y la autovigilancia glicémica","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

PDT is capable to induce different cell death mechanisms in vitro, triggered in a dose-dependent manner. Relationships between PDT and apoptosis or necrosis induction are well-known, but other cell death mechanisms triggered after PDT are less understood. Here we present our results in p53-deficient human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells subjected to sublethal PDT treatments (mortality about 40%) using Zn(II)-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) incorporated into liposomes. We obtained a rapid metaphase blockage of cells that also showed clearly altered configurations of the mitotic spindle. Cell cycle arrest was followed by aneuploidisation and cell death with apoptotic morphology. Apoptosis was also confirmed by occurrence of PARP cleavage and Bax translocation to mitochondria. These features are components of the cell death mechanism known as mitotic catastrophe and represent, to our knowledge, the first description of this cell death modality after PDT with ZnPc.","inCitations":["d8b1923fc507a8c7bed46f2e405e773140b98636","570b47151267a14e9492aef193137a3e34345f75"],"pdfUrls":["https://www.spandidos-publications.com/ijo/32/6/1189/download"],"title":"Mitotic catastrophe induced in HeLa cells by photodynamic treatment with Zn(II)-phthalocyanine.","doi":"10.3892/ijo.32.6.1189","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.3892/ijo.32.6.1189","venue":"International journal of oncology"}

Towards this end, we aimed to understand the therapeutic effectiveness of a polymer based vaccine approach at enhancing the anti-tumor responses in a tumor-bearing mouse model. While we and others have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of PLGA based systems in delivering antigen etc., studies scarcely focus on understanding the immunological mechanisms of polymer based therapies in tumor bearing treatment models. Considering tumors modulate the immune system and consequently the efficacy of therapies, understanding treatment mechanisms in the presence of tumor will help lead to more efficacious treatment options. We demonstrate here that a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) based delivery system encapsulating tumor antigen (OVA) and the TLR9 agonist CpG motif DNA administered into the tumor microenvironment initiates an effective type 1 mediated (IFN-γ producing) anti-tumor response in a syngeneic murine model of T cell lymphoma (E.G7-OVA). Although E.G7-OVA tumors spontaneously generate antigen specific CTLs in draining lymph nodes (LN), tumors progress rapidly. Modulation of the tumor microenvironment via local PLGA based therapy led to the generation of a systemic antigen specific Th1 response, absent in the non-polymer delivery method, subsequently associated with reduced tumor growth and prolongation of survival. These studies provide further insight into the use of a PLGA-based therapeutic approach at modulating the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need for analyzing the treatment effects in a tumor bearing model.","inCitations":["8d16e751ae291fadb3b6a02a1dbd1f8a0e868500","85e79d606a12bf12d49487194638e8a0c93e53af","5f030ce799e20c0489c02ff4a0479b32d93a66eb","358a19be38258a5694dc4cee2beb6cf10b2f65c4","52b195e21b0c2d4c608a3b11d2de64c53b3e5692"],"pdfUrls":["http://file.scirp.org/pdf/JCT_2013022616010387.pdf"],"title":"PLGA-polymer encapsulating tumor antigen and CpG DNA administered into the tumor microenvironment elicits a systemic antigen-specific IFN-γ response and enhances survival.","doi":"10.4236/jct.2013.41035","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.4236/jct.2013.41035","venue":"Journal of cancer therapy"}

Here we propose a novel SPIA format that uses microtitration immunological plates and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The novel and standard assays are exemplified by determination of immunoglobulin G by using 15-nm colloidal gold-protein A conjugates. We also describe a novel sol particle-trypsin assay using conjugates of gold nanoparticles with trypsin. The method is based on measuring spectral extinction changes caused by the addition of protein to a conjugate solution. The changes in the extinction spectra are presumed to be related to aggregation of gold nanoparticles caused by polyvalent binding of protein molecules to the trypsin molecules of the conjugates.","inCitations":["75a861f6cbf9d6d35154b01afe287d6424c95f15","2829032fa3c82714edbb82cd5171c12c560273b8","484cc11a7bf1edc566b49e3024d001c0941558fb","e6e1c86e32a3851fe345c3b69bda7bd1d31714c2","615d79229c2da770fe6f9aa59dc11eb3d02c7c75","83529d4de68997afe21ce9286c4bff3bd2c497b8","1dc5e834e55b3819c79230480f00177592439400","09f611768195689c50d798160fa09f8b78ddb181","475904b4a0a2952edd2913b634833f05305c5146","22018826853bf7d77ec32005ccd0dcb6cc1fbecf","c4ef655a9e53e645517cf5200205867036e475e3","ff5c922d5a3149bfca9a5248ed0c69a9fc2dab54","22d78b31d6bb55f516c6d6dfe321258e8765de47","18dfd042260b55c0b892744709e26364271bb035"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"A protein assay based on colloidal gold conjugates with trypsin.","doi":"10.1016/j.ab.2005.03.010","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2005.03.010","venue":"Analytical biochemistry"}

However, the images obtained from these devices have low resolution (LR) and poor quality that may not be suitable for retinal disease diagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for the super-resolution (SR) of the LR fundus images. The method takes into consideration the diagnostic information in the fundus images during the SR process. In this work, SR is performed on the zone of interest of the fundus images. Clinical information of the selected zone is captured using the Shannon entropy, the contrast sensitivity index (CSI), the multi-resolution (MR) intra-band energy and the MR inter-band eigen features. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to decide the clinical significance of the zone. Highly accurate learning based SR method or the bicubic interpolation is applied to the selected zone based on the classification output. The method is tested on the Standard Diabetic Retinopathy Database Calibration level 1 (DIARETDB1) and the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) databases. Classification accuracy of 85.22% and 85.77% is achieved for the DIARETDB1 and DRIVE databases respectively. The SR performance of the algorithm is quantified in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and computational time. The proposed diagnostic information based SR achieves computational time efficiency without compromising with the high resolution (HR) reconstruction accuracy of the fundus image zones.","inCitations":["4ad0a37218dbcd407f7943e939a5391a37062870"],"pdfUrls":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.002"],"title":"A novel diagnostic information based framework for super-resolution of retinal fundus images","doi":"10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.002","sources":["DBLP","Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compmedimag.2019.01.002","venue":"Comput.

In a related research, it is argued that one of the basic elements for this variation is due to student’s distinct learning styles. Planning learning situations based on the knowledge of learners’ learning styles can be more effective and efficient. With the learning-teaching process designed in accordance with the learning styles of students, it is possible to develop positive attitudes towards the courses and to increase academic success. Pre-service teachers' awareness of their own learning styles can be effective both for their own development during their pre-service training and for the development of their students during their in-service professional career. The purpose of the current study is to determine the learning styles of the pre-service basic education teachers and to examine the relationships between their learning styles and gender, age, program type, grade level and grade point average. In data collection, the Kolb Learning Style Inventory was used. The current study was conducted on 493 pre-service teachers randomly selected from among the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year students attending the Basic Education Departments of Classroom Teaching and Pre-school Teacher Education in the Education Faculty of Necmettin Erbakan University, in 2017/2018 academic year. In the analysis of the collected data, SPSS 24 program package was used. The pre-service teachers’ learning styles are presented through descriptive statistics, frequencies (f) and percentages (%). Whether the pre-service teachers’ learning styles vary significantly depending on the variables of gender, age, program type, grade level and grade point average was tested with Chi-Square Test. Of the participating pre-service teachers, 398 (80.7%) are females and 95 (19.3%) are males; 250 (50.7%) are from the department of classroom teaching and 243 (49.3%) are from the department of pre-school teacher education. The results of the current study have revealed that the participating pre-service teachers have adopted the “Diverging” learning style to the greatest extent and the “Converging” learning style to the smallest extent. \n \n   \n \n Key words: Basic education, student, learning styles, variables, evaluation.","inCitations":["2e452fc0509a3b950d07375bd086ee717e12b691"],"pdfUrls":["https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1207116.pdf"],"title":"An investigation of pre-service basic education teachers learning styles in terms of different variables","doi":"10.5897/ERR2019.3687","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.5897/ERR2019.3687","venue":""}

The study further showed that many of the respondents believe that the awareness on hepatitis B is low and preferred medium for the awareness are social media, radio, television, banners, door-to-door and others. The study thereby recommended that the government should sponsor different media awareness campaign geared towards the prevention of the transmission of “Hepatitis B Virus” (HBV) and the use of vaccine as a major alternative for prevention.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Media Public Enlightenment Campaign and Awareness of Hepatitis B in Lokoja Metropolis of Kogi State, Nigeria","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}

We find that the model has four distinct phases; crumpled, branched-polymer, linear, and tubular. The linear phase and the tubular phase appear to be separated by a first-order transition. It is also found that there is no long-range two-dimensional order in the model. In fact, no smooth surface can be seen in the whole region of the curvature modulus α, which is the coefficient of the deficit angle term in the Hamiltonian. The bending energy, which is not included in the Hamiltonian, remains large even at sufficiently large α in the tubular phase. On the other hand, the surface is spontaneously compactified into a one-dimensional smooth curve in the linear phase; one of the two degrees of freedom shrinks, and the other degree of freedom remains along the curve. Moreover, we find that the rotational symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken in the tubular phase just as in the same model on the fixed connectivity surfaces.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["http://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.3561v1.pdf","https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.3561v1.pdf","https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1140/epjb/e2007-00261-9"],"title":"Phase transitions in a fluid surface model with a deficit angle term","doi":"10.1140/epjb/e2007-00261-9","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1140/epjb%2Fe2007-00261-9","venue":""}

She made (entirely appropriate) autobiographical references to her \"lily-white\" upbringing in middle class Florida, which had required her to enroll in a home economics course that she refused to take, and she referred to the influence of Joan Baez, who first taught her about an activist poetic discourse (47-49). She introduced these autobiographical references in order to explain her interest in \"transformative\" language, in writing classrooms that resist the conventionalizing of students' thinking and forms of discourse. Noting that it is important to \"position oneself clearly,\" she identified herself particularly with \"those who were in school during the late sixties or early seventies,\" a group of \"youthful dreamers\" with \"visions of revolution,\" and she proposed bringing \"the passions and the dreams of transforma tion to our classrooms\" (46-47; emphasis added). Explicitly situating a work in composition studies within a genera tional horizon furthers the aim of the work only if the horizon is attended to with circumspection; the application of the concept of \"generation\" to composition studies needs to be thematized.

Feeding perference was significantly different between the resistant and susceptible rice plants, resulting in much lower on resistant ones and much higher on susceptible ones.

Methods Lumbar isthmus parameters were measured in normal lumbar x-rays and cadaveric specimens from a Chinese Han population. Distance between the medial pedicle border and lateral isthmus border was recorded as a ‘D’ value and was compared between X-rays and cadavers. Orthopaedic surgeons estimated different distances (2–6 mm) and angles (5–20°), and bias ratios between estimated and real values were compared. Orthopaedic residents placed pedicle screws on cadaveric specimens before and after application of the ‘D’ value, and screw placement accuracy was compared. Results Except for L4 vertebrae, significant differences in the ‘D’ value were found between 25 cadaveric specimens and x-ray films from 120 patients. Distances and angles estimated by 40 surgeons were significantly different from all real values, except 2 mm distance. Accuracy of pedicle screw placement by six orthopaedic residents was significantly improved by applying the ‘D’ value. Conclusions Surgeon estimates of distance were more accurate than angle estimates. Addition of a ‘D’ value to conventional parameters may significantly improve pedicle screw placement accuracy in lumbar spine surgery.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/25/43/10.1177_0300060518762986.PMC6023064.pdf"],"title":"Anatomical and radiologic characteristics of isthmus parameters in guiding pedicle screw placement","doi":"10.1177/0300060518762986","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060518762986","venue":"The Journal of international medical research"}

There are two kinds of cognitive models concerning asymmetry: similarity-based model and knowledge-based model. Similarity-based model includes similarity-coverage model (SCM), feature-based induction model (FBIM) and feature transfer model (FTM). Knowledge-based model contains hypothesis assessment model (HAM), the relevance theory and Bayesian model. The current paper reviews these models and presents their merits and demerits, and the future research directions of asymmetry in category-based induction are further discussed.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"类别归纳推理中的非对称性：模型与挑战 Asymmetries of Category-Based Induction: Models and Challenges","doi":"10.12677/AP.2013.36050","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.12677/AP.2013.36050","venue":""}

However, because of its effects on non-immune bystander cells, poly(I:C) administration may bear danger for the development of autoimmune diseases. Thus poly(I:C) should be applied in the lowest dose possible. We investigated microspheres carrying surface-assembled poly(I:C) as a two-in-one adjuvant formulation to stimulate maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs). Negatively charged polystyrene microspheres were equipped with a poly(ethylene glycol) corona through electrostatically driven surface assembly of a library of polycationic poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymers, PLL-g-PEG. Stable surface assembly of poly(I:C) was achieved by incubation of polymer-coated microspheres in an aqueous poly(I:C) solution. Surface-assembled poly(I:C) exhibited a strongly enhanced efficacy to stimulate maturation of MoDCs by up to two orders of magnitude, as compared to free poly(I:C). Multiple phagocytosis events were the key factor to enhance the efficacy. The cytokine secretion pattern of MoDCs after exposure to surface-assembled poly(I:C) differed from that of free poly(I:C), while their ability to stimulate T cell proliferation was similar. Overall, phagocytic signaling plays an important role in defining the resulting immune response to such two-in-one adjuvant formulations.","inCitations":["5a363201f53385dd300c533df4c4daac8ff070ff","55be0244a666eda6726f2f013ba7fcb2bb5bc0a7","9152fdb20fdeb6f39763d9dc90cbcb3153e21dc4","547f6093aba993d170a048926f25e3e73729099e","05a94a6ac03012d6877919e9c58185ba87199ac0","9851892a2675ff9d589c4df23ca57622d554f885","f2347cbcd61875de0bc7848a57ba9fc83655e827","f6e6283e6c43c9ad6696d3de6eb27407710bb4d5","eddb422cee0185e9869a71d3f0ddab229fce8e84","3c7ae6a72850399a4db8c4c8531b6d9e39ab84ef","01f80d4a10deb9fe414759c14d9f4707d36eeb25","d5f82b9bc153732f86b1b9aa1c9c0049ee2aab1b","003f5701b3d6f0bf46efa5d36db8be5ab78fc2f8","38ef0dfdff6232cda35ae1e22fc5c668d1863049"],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Tuning the immune response of dendritic cells to surface-assembled poly(I:C) on microspheres through synergistic interactions between phagocytic and TLR3 signaling.","doi":"10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.021","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.12.021","venue":"Biomaterials"}

All the cationic detergents studied are very effective inhibitors of bacterial metabolism at 1:3000 concentration, and several are equally active at 1:30,000. Few of the anionic detergents inhibit as effectively as the cationic compounds. 2. Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms are equally sensitive to the action of the cationic detergents. On the other hand, all the anionic detergents included in our studies selectively inhibit the metabolism of Gram-positive microorganisms. 3. The inhibitory action of both types of detergents is influenced markedly by hydrogen ion concentration. Cationic detergents exhibit their maximum activity in the alkaline pH range, and the anionic, in the acid range. 4. Studies of homologous series of straight chain alkyl sulfates and sulfoacetates (C(8) to C(18)) demonstrate that maximum inhibition is exerted by the 12, 14, and 16 carbon compounds (lauryl, myristyl, and cetyl). 5. It has been observed that three lauryl esters of amino acids are powerful inhibitors of bacterial metabolism. To our knowledge, the effects on bacterial metabolism of such cationic detergents (without the quaternary ammonium structure) have not been studied previously. Our results demonstrate that other cationic detergents can exhibit an inhibitory activity comparable to quaternary ammonium compounds. 6. Certain detergents stimulate bacterial metabolism at concentrations lower than the inhibiting values. This effect has been found more frequently among the anionic detergents.","inCitations":["e53c2614c7edbb64e8b0ad6a42462c062a3f12fb","e1795a1f1ad47602fbda1590a3b56a08d2026274","1eedf97e46b8acd420ecb68ec2550ed137ca57fc","366ec9ce2d59054e6b0b9a53e78e4a3e567344d8","295f2202dacdbfde1b7bf11423ae2e31c61738d3","2b90cfb11303aeb779d57ab828f183a983485d27","f5210e0d95adb63d76772f83f713abfa5b9bb5e6","a13c72e9f0be15a56b8ed89fd9e8d415f4606092","ec96ff1d2011df88797895aba48c1f289f02f1b4","eaa6b447eb286eb7d1515ee121b06bb11c3984a6","52db995c72a446d45cf39227aa2d20e85b088270","7b9c7b0432ca215e0113bed315d7230ac0cf9a8e","b011eccde635a5fff06627304882a6454185babc","0f5e546a778dad3f0dbe89b16995e02efef78d0b","16c844bcbacb549ae5e9db169673cc69e528dbbc","7b184b3f97d917868268a21eeffa3caea0e84cd8","234eab16269e27d297bf06ee6ff554d44e982168","de301f3e76e61ec56e782458141f54d2981f9af7","694aef8cb50c2d449ef3b5b3f58c1fd6c86b66d1","8b1902ecb27705712f511f306057b57868a1cefc","1851993200a31460030400c9752c0b62afbc4ee8","dee1ad289604b325f365cfc98e2a41e7b61e13f8","e238a8ce471cb57443737f07a7763c94f2560484","5f33eb23610b0a44e8513854d4ca77f88b50d0d7","7ea8bc1b0f413da61b6d6133c51a2569ea878b73"],"pdfUrls":["https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/oa_pdf/7e/76/249.PMC2135128.pdf","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc/7e/76/J_Exp_Med_1941_Jan_31_73(2)_249-271.tar.gz","http://jem.rupress.org/content/jem/73/2/249.full.pdf"],"title":"Action of Synthetic Detergents on the Metabolism of Bacteria","doi":"10.1084/jem.73.2.249","sources":["Medline"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.73.2.249","venue":"The Journal of experimental medicine"}

We demonstrate an adaptive system that moves an array of receivers according to an optimal positioning algorithm that is based on the theory of optimal experiments. The goal is to minimize the number of distinct measurements (array movements) needed to localize objects such as buried landmines. The adaptive localization algorithm has been tested using data collected in a laboratory facility. The performance of the algorithm is exhibited for cases with one or two targets and in the presence of common types of clutter such as rocks in the soil. Results are also shown for a case where the propagation properties of the medium vary spatially. In these tests, the landmines were located using three or four array movements. It is envisioned that future systems could incorporate this new method into a portable mobile mine-location system","inCitations":["e2d68b83182da250c733d62a9c18ccac42cb5683","08b86210b50c6ccfaaeabef2c214f063e8e2f6c2","118962c9c44e40c8a3686a73daf124fb3251fbd0","114fe632f8026601c298956977512e9d56a988df","dd95c18753632150ae80688118efa321125ba923","2924aac516d54e7f490ca6cdbb2a9f1808738e66","56f58c63510be06d2f8b34cd0bb407c5ac7585a6"],"pdfUrls":["http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/MURI/MA_optim4.pdf","http://waymond-scott.ece.gatech.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/531/2016/11/TGARRS_2007_Maneuvering.pdf","https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.894551","https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150565/files/Optimal%20maneuvering%20of%20seismic%20sensors%20for%20localization%20of%20subsurface%20targets.pdf","http://users.ece.gatech.edu/mcclella/MURI/MA_optim4_6June.pdf","http://www.ece.rice.edu/~vc3/TGSmine.pdf","http://users.ece.gatech.edu/wrscott/Papers/TGARRS_2007_Maneuvering.pdf"],"title":"Optimal Maneuvering of Seismic Sensors for Localization of Subsurface Targets","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2007.894551","sources":["DBLP"],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.894551","venue":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing"}

None of the insoluble S-beta-D-glycosyl copolymers prepared could be shown usable as affinity adsorbent for glycosidases though the corresponding soluble copolymers inhibited the activity of the enzymes.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Studies on lectins.

Epitheliogenesis imperfecta is rare anomaly of calves, piglets, foals, lambs, puppies, and kittens. Three cases of epitheliogenesis imperfecta in Korean indigenous calves were diagnosed in animal and Plant Quarantine Agency in 2011∼2014. In this paper, we tried to report them in detailed and compare with similar cases occurred in other countries. Key words : Congenital, Epitheliogenesis imperfecta, Korean indigenous calves 서 론 불완전상피발생은 피부의 편평상피와 부속기 및 구강 점막 상피의 발생 부전인 피부 결손증으로 다양한 병변 발생 정도를 보이며(Yager와 Scott, 1993), 기저막 위나 기저세포 내에 수포가 길게 갈라지는 틈을 갖는 피부질병이다(Donald 등, 2001). 일부 동물에서는 유전성이지만 그 밖의 동물에서는 유전성이 입증되지 않고 있으며, 가축에서는 흔치 않은 질병으로 소, 어린양, 새끼돼지, 강아지, 고양이 등에서 선천적인 질환으로 보고되었다(Bentinck-Smith, 1951; Ginn 등, 2007; Hadley와 Cole, 1928; Munday, 1970; Sailer 1955). 육안적인 병변으로 안면, 사지말단 또는 점막면에 경계가 명확한 궤양이 생성되는데 주둥이와 코, 입술, 구강 등에만 나타나는 병변, 사지 원위부 전체에 걸쳐 나타나는 병변 등 다양하게 나타난다 (Hardly, 1927). 피부는 털이 없고 매끈하며 촉촉하고 붉은색을 띄며 구강이나 식도의 점막하 조직이 노출된다(Donald 등, 2001). 따라서 표피를 보호하는 편평 상피가 없어 하부 조직은 쉽게 외상을 받아 감염이 일어나며, 균혈증으로 진전될 수도 있다(Donald 등, 2001). 발굽, 발톱, 귀, 입술 및 눈꺼풀을 포함한 전체 피부가 감염될 만큼 광범위하게 병변이 형성될 수 있으며, 병변이 광범위한 태아는 일반적으로 태어나자마자 죽는다(Ginn 등, 2007). 이가 기형적으로 형성되기도 하며, 귓바퀴가 없을 수도 있고 태아가 영향을 받은 경우 유산될 수도 있다(Dalir-Naghadeh 등, 2004). 조직학적으로는 표피가 갑작스럽게 결핍되어 표피, 모낭, 샘 등이 없는 것이 관찰되며 진피에서 피부 부속기의 결핍 혹은 땀샘이나 피지분비선이 전혀 없어서 모낭이 제대로 발달하지 못한 것을 관찰할 수 있다(Ginn 등, 2007). 본 이번 연구의 목적은 불완전상피발생 사례들의 임상증상, 병리학적 소견을 보고하여 진단과 예방에 도움을 주는 것이다.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Epitheliogenesis imperfecta in three Korean indigenous calves","doi":"10.7853/kjvs.2015.38.3.189","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7853/kjvs.2015.38.3.189","venue":""}

They are difficult to identify by conventional methods of quantitative chemical analysis, but their detrimental effects can be detected by biological methods. The goal of this study was to develop novel methodological approaches to the express assessment of the state of the environment as well as toxicity of its components in the process of biological monitoring at hazardous industrial facilities. The article presents the results of comprehensive toxicity assessment of environmental objects using originally developed system of express methods. The objects of research were water fleas (Daphnia magna Straus and Ceriodaphnia affinis Lilljeborg), infusoria (Paramecium caudatum), preparation of lyophilized fluorescent bacteria based on recombinant Escherichia coli strain M-17 (Ecolum), algae (Chlorella vulgaris Beijer, Scenedesmus quadricauda (Turp.) Breb.), and mammalian gonads. The original methods for determining toxicity by changing the motor activity of water fleas at elevated temperatures of the studied environment are described. The description of the following original utility models is presented: “Method of bioassay for water samples and device for its implementation”, “Device for express assessment of natural environment quality” and “Device for comprehensive assessment of natural environment quality”, confirmed by the patents of the Russian Federation. Their use may significantly reduce the cost of ecotoxicological studies in terms of time and money expenditures. The effectiveness of the system of express methods was established during a biological monitoring of a sanitary protection zone of the Balakovo NPP. Toxicity of the samples of bottom sediments, soil, as well as water samples from the cooler pond and the adjacent water area of the Saratov reservoir were identified. The bioassay results were matched by both conventional methods’ results and originally developed system of express methods.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":["https://sevin.elpub.ru/jour/article/viewFile/172/148"],"title":"Development and Efficiency Assessment of New Methods on Rapid Assessment of Toxicity in Environmental Monitoring","doi":"10.35885/1684-7318-2019-4-458-469","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.35885/1684-7318-2019-4-458-469","venue":""}

In a previous original piece of work, a new approach to find the EOQ with backlogging using some slight algebraic developments appeared.

The view of most people is that art and mathematics could not be more different. One is left brain, the other right brain. One is creative, the other analytical. While this prevailing view is a partial truth, what mathematician has not marveled at the beauty of an elegant proof, and what serious artist has not been aware of the importance of form and composition to a successful art work? Both disciplines are creative endeavors with analytical components that are essential elements of contemporary civilization. Here, we hope to make the case that, like the yin/yang symbol, art and mathematics are really one in two, and two in one. Here, we will discuss some of the ways that mathematics and art are both similar and different; how they express complementary aspects of life and culture; and how they both share a fundamental unity on a deeper level. Mathematics can indeed be defined as the general science of pattern and structure. Because art also involves patterns and structures, art and math relate to each other in many natural ways, which is the basis for this exploration. This exploration has also produced collaborations with artists working with mathematical themes and has coincided with several recent art exhibitions in Colorado. These art exhibitions have been exploring the idea that art and mathematics are intimately related on a deeper level. We will also discuss some recent Colorado art exhibitions that provide good examples of how the collaboration between mathematics and art has found public expression.","inCitations":["bd479c7fb36df13abbd2b6812df3a539c7d2a500","337223ae27d038f8034eb497fc0194fe3ca1d0ed"],"pdfUrls":["http://www.dougcraftfineart.com/PDF/MathHorizons-Feb05-pp12-15.pdf"],"title":"One in Two, Two in One: Mathematics and the Arts","doi":"10.1080/10724117.2005.12021799","sources":[],"doiUrl":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10724117.2005.12021799","venue":""}

Relative amounts of clonally rearranged and germline antigen receptor gene DNA were assessed by Southern analysis of bone marrow cell DNA, before and after LTMC in studies on ten cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), four of myeloma (MM), and two of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Clonally rearranged DNA became undetectable during LTMC in 12 studies (seven NHL, four MM, one CLL), and in seven of these studies the extent of the decrease determined by densitometric analysis of rearranged and germline bands on the autoradiograms was sufficient to demonstrate that preferential loss of neoplastic relative to other cell series had taken place. At the same time, there was a net increase in normal myeloid series, to indicate that a selective adverse effect similar to that reported to operate on leukemic cells in LTMC also applied to certain malignancies involving the lymphocytic lineage. In four of the 16 studies (three NHL, one CLL), the neoplastic cells possessing clonally rearranged DNA were maintained in LTMC, demonstrating that susceptibility to this selective adverse effect was not a uniform characteristic of neoplastic lymphocytic disorders.","inCitations":[],"pdfUrls":[],"title":"Clonally rearranged antigen receptor gene DNA studies in evaluation of susceptibility of neoplastic lymphocytic and plasmacytic disorders to selective loss in long-term marrow culture.","doi":"","sources":[],"doiUrl":"","venue":""}
